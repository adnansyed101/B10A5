              Sixty-year-old Kofil Uddin watched helplessly as floodwater crept
              into his home at Bhabani Jibanpur village in Noakhali's Begumganj
              upazila on August 10. More than a month has passed, but the house
              is still under knee-deep water. Floods devastated much of
              Chattogram and Sylhet divisions in Bangladesh last month following
              a sudden surge of water from the upstream in India, coupled with
              heavy rainfall. Although floodwater has receded in most areas,
              more than half of Noakhali remains under water.

              Flood situation in Feni, Cumilla, and Noakhali has worsened due to
              relentless rainfall and a rise in the water level of rivers,
              leaving over 1.5 million people stranded. The situation is equally
              dire in Parshuram, where one person has been reported missing. The
              Feni-Parshuram regional road is now impassable, and many areas
              have been without electricity since last night. In Fulgazi,
              thousands of people across six unions are stranded. According to
              Fulgazi Upazila Executive Officer Tania Bhuiyan, the Feni-Bilonia
              regional highway has been submerged, effectively cutting off road
              communication between the district headquarters and the upazila.

              In the public sector in Bangladesh, job reservations for specific
              disadvantaged groups have existed since independence. The most
              recent quota system, which included provisions for up to 56
              percent of jobs going to those who fall under various quotas, was
              abolished for first- and second-class jobs in 2018 following a
              government circular. Previous quota systems, however, reserved an
              even higher percentage of jobs for various groups.The history of
              civil service in this region goes back to the British period.
              Until the early 20th century, the Imperial Civil Service (ICS), as
              it was known then, was largely dominated by European officers.
              After the First World War, following a British parliamentary
              resolution, a quota was instituted for Indian candidates in the
              ICS.
